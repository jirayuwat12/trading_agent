# Trading Agent

This is a group project of the class 2110593 Explainable-AI.
Members; M, Pooh, Tata, PP

## Overview

This project creates a trading agent that can trade on the stock market using HMM (Hidden Markov Model).
To make the simplest environment, we defined a game that only need to predict the next price of a stock -> "up" or "down".
If the prediction is correct, the agent will get a reward of +1, otherwise -1, and every time the agent makes a prediction, it will lose 0.01 points.

## Models

We implemented 4 models;

1. Random Agent
2. Only buy Agent
3. Only sell Agent
4. HMM Agent -- our model

And the results are compared among those models which you can see in the result folder.

## Details

Please check the slide in result folder for more details about the project.
